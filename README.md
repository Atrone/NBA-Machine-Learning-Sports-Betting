# Slam-Dunk-Streamline üèÄ

## Best efficacy seen during PLAYOFFS 

A fork of a popular NBA machine learning project that adds depth to each module.

Automagically knows today's season and adapts accordingly... almost.

*IMPORTANT*: Every season, before betting, you need to add the schedule for the season as a csv. (See: nba-2023-UTC.csv)...Add the reference to this csv in main.py

Complete with PowerShell scheduled jobs and the results sensitivity analyzed in a front-end, this fork aims to make it very easy to bet intelligently.

You can start a scheduled job (cron, task scheduler, etc) that simply runs ```run_and_email.py``` and everything else is handled.

Or you can just run the file manually and wait for the email, that works too.
