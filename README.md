Complete with PowerShell scheduled jobs and the results sensitivity analyzed in a front-end, this fork aims to make it very easy to bet intelligently.

You can start a scheduled job (cron, task scheduler, etc) that simply runs ```run_and_email.py``` and everything else is handled.

Or you can just run the file manually and wait for the email, that works too.
